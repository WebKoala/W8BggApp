+ Main page
-> Fix scrolling  (the plays' list insists on scrolling vertically, fixed this now by adding 6 items max to user plays)
-> Fix No Account
-> Fix Hotness info (requires separate load to API service to get hotness info)
-> Fix Click on Hotness items
-> Implement color scheme based on rating 

+ Collection page
-> Change filter to suggested (by Tom) popup 
-> Add watermark to search.
-> What's the idea with slide 11? It is very beautiful, but it shows to few games (imho) maybe I could implement it as a different view later on.

+ ALL
-> Check geekmails / notifications (not sure if possible without scraping)
->
